# dotfiles

**Personal terminal/editor configs and reusable prompts to streamline dev workflows.**

---

Setting up a new machine shouldn‚Äôt mean hunting down dotfiles and rewriting the same shell prompts. This repo gathers my Vim and tmux setup plus a small library of copy‚Äëpasteable prompts for common tasks like generating READMEs, opening PRs, and writing concise commits.

It‚Äôs deliberately minimal: a few well‚Äëtuned config files and focused prompts that help you move fast without guessing conventions.

## üß† What is dotfiles?
A lightweight collection of editor/terminal configuration and practical prompts for consistent, speedy developer workflows.

- Centralizes Vim and tmux preferences for frictionless setup
- Provides high‚Äëquality prompts for PRs, commits, reviews, and repo discovery
- Encourages concise, conventional, and verifiable practices (IDD/TDD mindset)

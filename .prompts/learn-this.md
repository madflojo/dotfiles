# Learn the Project

- Read the **documentation, code, configurations, Makefiles, tests, and other relevant files**.  
- Do not assume documentation is complete or accurate — verify by examining the actual code.  
- Develop a solid understanding of the **architecture, goals, and key components**.  
- Take note of **design patterns, dependencies, and conventions** that shape the project.  

## Learning Objectives
- **Purpose & Goals**  
  - What is the project for?  
  - What problem(s) does it solve?  
  - Who is the intended audience or user?  

- **Main Features**  
  - Core functionality and modules.  
  - Special or standout features.  
  - What differentiates it from alternatives?  

- **Technologies & Frameworks**  
  - Languages, libraries, frameworks, and tools in use.  
  - External dependencies (databases, queues, services, etc.).  
  - Build/test infrastructure (Makefiles, CI/CD, etc.).  

- **Architecture & Design**  
  - Overall architecture (monolith, microservices, layered, event-driven, etc.).  
  - Key components and how they interact.  
  - Important **architectural decisions** and trade-offs.  
  - Scalability, extensibility, and testability considerations.  

- **Maintainability & Resiliency (from reviewing prompts)**  
  - Is the project documented and easy to navigate?  
  - How resilient is the design to failures?  
  - Are tests and error-handling approaches visible?

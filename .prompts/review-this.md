# Review Code or Documentation

- Familiarize yourself with the project or item (code, docs, or related files).
- Give a **0–10 rating** (10 = excellent, 0 = poor) with an emoji reaction and a short rationale.
- Provide both **category ratings** and an **overall rating**.
- Provide a **summary checklist** (✅ = good, ⚠️ = needs work, ❌ = missing).
- Suggest improvements clearly — don’t sugarcoat; highlight challenges.
- Keep reviews **concise and structured**: bullet list + rationale > long essay.

## Rating Criteria

### For Code
Rate across the following dimensions:

**Code Quality**
- Readability: Is the code easy to follow?
- Consistency: Style/formatting consistent? Follows language conventions?
- Simplicity: Is logic as simple/clear as possible?
- Correctness: Any obvious bugs or questionable logic?

**Architecture & Design**
- Modularity: Is code broken into reusable, composable units?
- Separation of Concerns: Responsibilities well-distributed across modules?
- Scalability: Can design handle growth in users, data, or features?
- Extensibility: How easy is it to add a new feature?
- Testability: Is code structured to be easily testable?

**Maintainability**
- Documentation: README, CONTRIBUTING guides, inline comments, user docs?
- Test Coverage: Are there meaningful unit/functional tests?
- Error Handling: Failures handled gracefully with clear diagnostics?
- Dependency Management: Dependencies minimal, current, and well managed?

**Performance & Efficiency**
- Resource Use: CPU, memory, disk, and network efficiency.
- Benchmarking: Any tools or results for performance testing?
- Latency / Critical Path: Is latency profile optimized? Critical tasks offloaded?

**Security**
- Input Validation: Is user input sanitized/validated?
- Secrets Management: Are secrets excluded from code, handled safely?
- Least Privilege: APIs/components scoped to minimum access?

**Resiliency**
- Defensive Programming: Safe handling of maps, arrays, error returns?
- Failure Scenarios: Handles dependency issues (HTTP errors, DB failures, etc.)?

### For Documentation
Rate across the following dimensions:

- **Substance**: Does it cover what readers need?
- **Packaging**: Is it structured logically?
- **Accuracy**: Is it factually correct and up to date?
- **Effectiveness**: Does it help the intended audience?
- **Clarity**: Is it clear and free of ambiguity?
- **Quality**: Overall professionalism and polish.

## Output Format
1. **Category Ratings (0–10 each)** with short rationale.
2. **Overall Rating (0–10)** with emoji + brief explanation.
3. **Checklist Summary** (✅/⚠️/❌).
4. **Suggestions for Improvement** (specific, concise, actionable).
